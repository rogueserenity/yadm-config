# oh-my-zsh Customizations

## Theme

Set the theme to use for zsh

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="gianu"
```

## Plugins

Set the plugins to use

```zsh
plugins=(brew git gpg-agent keychain macos mvn sudo vi-mode wd)
```

## Set Custom Location

oh-my-zsh no longer reacts well to overwriting the custom directory. Check this repo out to another
location and set the location in the `.zshrc`
```zsh
ZSH_CUSTOM=~/.ohmyzsh-config
```
